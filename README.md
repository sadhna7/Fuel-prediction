# Fuel-prediction
Here, we will try to analyze the features  and based on it, we will implement Linear regression to the problem.
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes. Here, we have independent features such as horsepower, weight, displacement, accleration, model_year, origin etc and dependent variable as mpg of the automobile.since the labels are provided and they are continous variables,it can be thought of as a regression problem.
